# data_visualization
This is a data visualization project done at baruch college. The purpose of this project was to ingest data about customer's loan approval status and use machine larning models to understand which attributes of a customer are taken most into account when decided to approve or deny a customer for a loan. Afterwards the models and outcomes were to be represented visually
